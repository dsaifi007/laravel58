If cooking more than 1 pizza, we suggest you use the fan setting on your oven.  If you do not have a fan oven, then we recommend that you cook each pizza on a separate shelf and swap the pizzas over in the oven half way through cooking so that both pizzas will be ready to enjoy at the same time.","Hints & Tips:_x000D_
